            My programming fundamentals started in the world of Java as I worked
            on getting my CS Degree and my first programming job. This really
            helped me to get a strong foundation in working with a fully typed
            language and the concepts of OOP. Many people will scoff at the idea
            of someone actually enjoying Java but I had and have no qualms with
            it!

            My first product was an on premise desktop app with an outdated
            external API. I saw this as an opportunity to learn JavaScript and
            TypeScript and dive into more of the web world with my project to
            build a REST API wrapper around the desktop API.

            I love to learn about new technologies. I follow many Tech
            &quot;Influencers&quot; on YouTube and Twitter just to try to stay
            up to date. This led me to learning about Tailwind CSS v1 and Chakra
            UI. Comparing the two I found that Chakra UI was easier for me at
            the time and this is honestly where I learned most of my CSS
            knowledge. I loved how the CSS properties were props in the React
            Components.

            I also learned about NextJS and the cool ways to generate static
            HTML pages with data from a database. At this same time Age of
            Empires 4 was coming out. As I was playing early releases of Age of
            Empires 4 I wanted to put my newfound Chakra UI and NextJS to the
            test.

            . While I&apos;ve been here I have been able to help other
            developers in many ways. I thoroughly enjoy writing TypeScript and
            one of my first refactors that I participated in was updating all of
            our models to actually be typed instead of using the dreaded&nbsp;
            <code className="bg-gray-700 font-mono">
              {"{"} [x: any]: any; {"}"}
            </code>
            &nbsp; to define all fields. I also like to write out my TypeSript
            learnings and hints on X. Here is one example:&nbsp;
            <a
              className="hover:text-gray-50 underline"

              Generic for Promise.allSettled
            </a>
            . It is a pretty simple use of a generic but it brings some type
            safety to a common Promise function. This does create more memory so
            maybe not the best practice when you are focusing purley on
            performance but I have found this little function to be very helpful
            in our projects with many fresh TypeScript devs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also find a lot of use for generics in React when creating custom
            Form Components while using a form library. This example uses&nbsp;
